# National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI) Project
The NPRI Project uses machine learning to analyze pollutant release and disposal data, forecasting trends over five years. 

## Project Overview
The **National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI) Project** is focused on forecasting trends in pollutant releases and disposals over the next five years using historical data. By leveraging advanced machine learning models, this project aims to enhance decision-making processes related to environmental impact and resource management.

## Key Features
- **Forecasting Trends:** Accurate predictions for pollutant release and disposal trends.
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Addressing inconsistencies, missing values, and duplicates in large datasets.
- **Feature Engineering:** Developing meaningful features for improved model performance.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Random Forest, Linear Regression, and Decision Trees for accurate predictions.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib
- **Data Visualization:** Dashboards and visual tools for trend analysis
- **Deployment Tools:** Jupyter Notebook for analysis and reporting
